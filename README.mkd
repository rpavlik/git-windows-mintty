## Download
Download from the GitHub page above by clicking "Downloads", or follow
this **direct link to the [MinTTY for Git for Windows download
page][download].**

## About
Adds a context menu (right-click) item to folders for "Git Bash Here
(MinTTY)" which will open your standard Git Bash in the very comfortable
[MinTTY][] console instead of the painful Windows one. Uninstall will
similarly remove the entry, keeping things nice and tidy.

Includes [MinTTY][] 1.0.3, MSYS version.

For a useful quick summary of why [MinTTY][] is cool, see

This package is mostly just a nice installer around [MinTTY][], a
Windows Scripting Host script to tidily perform the appropriate
launching, and the registry entries needed to add a context menu item.
It must be installed to the same place as Git, and you must already have
[Git for Windows][] installed.

## Building
You can get the precompiled binary installer from the [downloads page][download]. 
However if you want to build the installer from source:

- Install [Inno Setup][]
- Right-click `setup.iss` and select **Compile**
- The installer is created in the `Output` directory

## Changelog

### Version 1.1 - 17 May 2012
Bug-fix release: launch using the right Windows Scripting Host executable
to avoid [this bug plaguing Git for Windows][gitwinbug] that causes problems
only on Windows XP x64 and Server 2003 x64.  Yes, this means that not only is
this a nicer terminal to use, it's also a workaround for a bothersome bug!
